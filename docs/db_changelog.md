## 2026-07-22 — Patch Steven Vidal Sam Cali school (HTWN → Hackettstown) + alias

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260722_patch_vidal_sam_cali_school.sql`

**What changed:**

4 tournament_bouts rows in Sam Cali Battle for The Belt updated:
`wrestler_school_id` changed from 240 (Haddon Township) → 112 (Hackettstown)
for wrestler Steven Vidal (`ccd2a21c-ac71-41bf-aaf3-db101f1a70ea`), rounds R2, QF, SF, 3rd_Place.

Root cause: "HTWN" (Hackettstown abbreviation used in Sam Cali CSV) had no alias
entry. Importer's trigram fuzzy matcher resolved it to "Haddon Twp Hgh School"
(school 240). Fix: added `HTWN → school 112` to school_aliases (id 1669).

Note: user said "3 bouts" but there were 4. All 4 patched.

**Applied:** 2026-07-22 via service_role PATCH + INSERT.

## 2026-07-22 — school_aliases OOS support (nullable school_id, partial indexes, confirmed_at)

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260722_school_aliases_oos_support.sql`

**What changed:**

1. `school_id` made nullable. OOS confirmation rows store `school_id = NULL`,
   `alias_type = 'oos'`. The FK to `schools(id)` remains; NULLs bypass it.

2. `school_aliases_alias_unique` (full UNIQUE on alias) dropped. Replaced by:
   - `school_aliases_nj_alias_unique`: UNIQUE(alias) WHERE school_id IS NOT NULL
     — preserves SPP-fix protection for NJ aliases
   - `school_aliases_oos_alias_unique`: UNIQUE(alias) WHERE alias_type = 'oos'
     — prevents duplicate OOS confirmations per raw string

3. `confirmed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()` added. Auto-set on insert.
   Existing rows get NULL (predates the column).

**Why UNIQUE(alias) was too strict for OOS:**
"CBA" can legitimately be both NJ's Christian Brothers Academy (school_id = X)
and an OOS school at a PA tournament. A global unique constraint made confirming
one permanently block the other. The two partial indexes preserve NJ-to-NJ
disambiguation while allowing same-string NJ + OOS coexistence.

**Lookup policy:** NJ alias rows are checked before OOS rows. If "CBA" → school
42 (NJ) and "CBA" → OOS both exist, the NJ match wins.

**Verified?** No — apply via Supabase SQL editor before using the OOS confirmation
UI in /admin/import-tournament.

## 2026-07-22 — Patch 40 tournament_bouts rows: UNK → CSF

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260722_patch_unk_csf_rounds.sql`

**What changed:**

40 `tournament_bouts` rows across 5 tournaments (Bethlehem 4, King of the Castle 5,
Linn Crawn 8, Palmyra 23, Elmwood Park 0) had `round = 'UNK'` due to a parser bug:
when the pipe CSV `round` field was empty and the round was embedded as a name prefix
(`"Cons. Semis - William Shallop"`), `import_pipe_csv.py` stripped the prefix but
discarded it rather than using it to populate the round column. All 40 were consolation
semifinals and have been corrected to `CSF`. 6 bouts remain `UNK` (Linn Crawn 5,
Elmwood Park 1) — their round is genuinely absent from the source data.

**ALREADY APPLIED** 2026-07-22 via service_role API. Migration file documents what ran.

**Rollback:**
```sql
-- Only needed if the patch introduced wrong data; these 40 rows were all
-- confirmed CSF by matching against the original CSV source.
-- No automated rollback — would require re-checking each bout individually.
```

---

## 2026-07-21 — Unique constraint on school_aliases.alias

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260721_school_aliases_unique_constraint.sql`

**What changed:**

Adds `UNIQUE(alias)` constraint to `public.school_aliases` via `school_aliases_alias_unique`.
The migration first removes the duplicate SPP row (two rows pointing to school_id 167 were
created when the SPP alias was inserted before the constraint existed).

**Why UNIQUE(alias) and not UNIQUE(school_id, alias):**
The SPP incident (South Plainfield vs. St. Peter's Prep both using "SPP") showed that
allowing the same alias string for two schools produces silent non-deterministic bugs in
`matchSchools.ts`, which uses `.find()` on the alias array. The right answer is a more
specific alias for the less common usage, not tolerance of duplicates at the DB level.

**Rollback:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.school_aliases DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS school_aliases_alias_unique;
```

**Verified?** No — apply via Supabase SQL editor.

## 2026-07-20 — Add tw_id to wrestlers, source_format to tournament_bouts ⚠️ APPLY BEFORE pipe CSV import

**Migration files (apply in this order):**
1. `docs/migrations/20260720_add_tw_id_to_wrestlers.sql`
2. `docs/migrations/20260720_add_source_format_to_tournament_bouts.sql`

**What changed:**

**1. wrestlers.tw_id (bigint, nullable)**

Adds a `tw_id` column (TrackWrestling profile ID) to the `wrestlers` table and a partial unique index (`wrestlers_tw_id_idx`) that enforces no two wrestlers share a tw_id while allowing NULL. Used as the primary deduplication key for pipe-format CSV imports: when a CSV row carries a non-null `tw_id_winner`/`tw_id_loser`, the script resolves the wrestler by tw_id before falling back to name+school trigram matching. NULL for all pre-existing wrestlers (added via RTF/PDF imports before this column existed).

**2. tournament_bouts.source_format (text, nullable → backfilled)**

Adds a `source_format` column to `tournament_bouts` to record which import pipeline produced each row: `'pipe'` (pipe-delimited CSV), `'rtf'` (RTF bracket file), `'pdf'` (bracket PDF reconstruction), `'bullet'` (bullet-format CSV). Back-fills all existing rows with `'rtf'` since every pre-migration bout came from the RTF import pipeline.

**Why:**
- tw_id enables reliable cross-season wrestler identity without depending on exact name matching
- source_format enables querying bracket fidelity (PDF = full bracket vs. pipe = results-only)

**Rollback:**
```sql
-- migration 2: remove source_format
ALTER TABLE tournament_bouts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS source_format;
-- migration 1: remove tw_id
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS wrestlers_tw_id_idx;
ALTER TABLE wrestlers DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS tw_id;
```

**Verified?** No — apply via Supabase SQL editor before running `scripts/import_pipe_csv.py`

## 2026-07-20 — Emergency rescue: girls precomputed_team_scores (8 schools) ⚠️ APPLY IMMEDIATELY

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260720_rescue_girls_precomputed_team_scores.sql`

**What changed:**

Data-only migration (no DDL). Re-inserts `precomputed_team_scores` rows for 8 girls schools that were deleted by Step 2 of `20260719_girls_tournament_entries_school_id.sql`.

Root cause of deletion: Step 2 correctly removed stale rows keyed by raw `school_context_raw` strings (e.g. `'Jackson Township H.S.'`) with `school_id = NULL`. However, `top_postseason_team_scores` reads **only** from `precomputed_team_scores` with no live fallback — the CLAUDE.md note "the RPC recomputes live" is incorrect for this case. All 8 schools disappeared from the girls Postseason Point Leaders immediately after Step 2 ran.

Step 1 of the prior migration had already set correct `tournament_entries.school_id` for all 8 schools, so the scoring RPCs (`district_team_score`, `girls_region_team_score`, `state_team_score`) now return them with proper `school_id` and `display_name`. This migration loops all girls season-2 tournaments and re-INSERTs rows for only the 8 target school_ids.

Schools restored:
- 370 Jackson Township, 32 High Point, 260 Kingsway, 263 Rancocas Valley
- 190 Hunterdon Central, 216 Trenton, 391 Passaic Tech, 259 Gloucester

Tournament types: `girls_districts`, `girls_regions`, `girls_state` (matching existing data convention).

**Rollback:** `DELETE FROM precomputed_team_scores WHERE school_id = ANY(ARRAY[370,32,260,263,190,216,391,259]) AND season_id = 2;`

**Verified?** No — run verify query in migration file after applying

## 2026-07-19 — Girls tournament_entries school_id fix (8 schools)

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260719_girls_tournament_entries_school_id.sql`

**What changed:**

Step 1 (APPLIED): `UPDATE tournament_entries SET school_id = X` for 8 girls schools whose `school_context_raw` names didn't match `schools.display_name` during import, leaving `school_id = NULL`. Scope: `season_id = 2, gender = 'F'`.

Step 2 (APPLIED — caused live breakage, see 20260720 rescue above): `DELETE FROM precomputed_team_scores WHERE school_name IN (raw_names) AND season_id = 2`. Removed stale rows with incorrect `school_id = NULL` and raw-name keys.

**Rollback:** See rollback block at bottom of migration file (reverses Step 1 only).

---

## 2026-07-19 — Waldwick (school 9): logo URL + header_background

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260719_waldwick_school9_update.sql`

**What changed:**

- `logo_url` → `.svg` path (`9.svg`, new file uploaded to Supabase Storage)
- `header_background` → `#6A7CB5` (Light Blue)

**Rollback:** See rollback block at bottom of migration file.

**Verified?** Applied 2026-07-19.

## 2026-07-17 — Rewrite 8 scoring RPCs to use school_id ⚠️ PENDING REVIEW

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260717_rewrite_scoring_rpcs_use_school_id.sql`

**What changed:**

Rewrites 8 multi-param scoring RPC overloads (the ones with `p_season smallint`, created by `update_team_scoring.py`) to aggregate by `tournament_entries.school_id` instead of `school_context_raw` + `school_names` name matching. Also repopulates `precomputed_team_scores` from the corrected RPC output.

Functions rewritten:
- `district_team_score(integer, gender_type, smallint)`
- `region_team_score(integer, gender_type, smallint)`
- `girls_region_team_score(text, smallint)`
- `state_team_score(gender_type, smallint)`
- `district_team_pts(integer, gender_type, smallint)`
- `region_team_pts(integer, gender_type, smallint)`
- `girls_region_team_pts(text, smallint)`
- `state_team_pts(gender_type, smallint)`

Single-param overloads of these functions (from `create_girls_rpcs.py` / `fix_state_rpcs.py`) are NOT touched.

Output shape: adds `school_id integer` to all 8 function return types (was always null before; app's TypeScript types already declared it). `school text` now returns `school_id::text` instead of the `school_context_raw` abbreviation string.

Root cause fixed: the old pipeline grouped by `school_context_raw` → joined `school_names` by abbreviation → got a text display name → `precomputed_team_scores` backfilled school_id by matching that text to `schools.display_name`. Two name-matching hops caused school 363 (Cherry Hill combined co-op) to accumulate boys district points that belong to school 268 (Cherry Hill West).

**Rollback:** Re-run `update_team_scoring.py` to restore old function bodies; restore `precomputed_team_scores` from backup or re-run old pipeline.

**Verified?** No — run verification query in migration file first

## 2026-07-16 — Logo upload + header_background update, all 325 schools ⚠️ PENDING REVIEW

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260716_logo_upload_all_325.sql`

**What changed:**

Data migration (no DDL). Sets `logo_url` and `header_background` on all 325 active schools.
Unconditional overwrite — every image manually confirmed correct before upload.

- **Images:** 325/325 logos processed (crop 7% symmetric, pad 8% L/R with corner fill, 512×512 PNG) and uploaded to Supabase Storage at `school-logos/colored/512/{school_id}.png`
- **`logo_url`:** Set to `https://vhffduvgcljvhtlyqgcd.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/school-logos/colored/512/{school_id}.png` for all 325 schools
- **`header_background`:** Set from `school_text_colors.csv` (all values validated as `#RRGGBB` hex)
- Special cases confirmed in place: Holmdel 189 → `#454444`, Warren Hills 67 → `#808080`, Garfield 53 → `#000000`, Red Bank Catholic 264 → `#000000`, South Hunterdon 136 → `#6F777B`, St. Augustine 313 → `#9CBEE1`
- School 358 (Roselle) UPDATE is included but is a no-op until `20260716_restore_roselle_358.sql` runs first

**Prior state (for context):** 171/325 schools had NULL `logo_url`; 218/325 had NULL `header_background`. Rollback block in migration file restores exact prior values per school.

**Rollback:** See commented block at bottom of migration file — paste into Supabase SQL editor.

**Verified?** No — pending review before execution

## 2026-07-16 — Restore school 358 (Roselle / Abraham Clark HS) ⚠️ PENDING APPROVAL

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260716_restore_roselle_358.sql`

**What changed:**

Reverses the school 358 portion of `20260420_school_dedup_final.sql`, which incorrectly deleted Roselle on the sole basis of having zero postseason tournament entries.

| Step | Table | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `schools` | INSERT id=358 — Roselle, Rams, #CC0022, North II Group 2, Union County |
| 2 | `school_districts` | INSERT school_id=358, district_id=16 |
| 3 | `conference_standings` | INSERT id=895 — UCIAC Mountain division, season 2, 3W–14L (0–7 div), 349 PF / 930 PA |

**Why the April 20 deletion was wrong:**

`20260410_suppress_shell_schools.sql` had explicitly listed school 358 among the schools to *keep active*, noting it had real conference W/L data. That decision was overridden ten days later by the dedup migration without re-examining it. School 358 had zero postseason tournament entries but a real regular-season record.

**Policy established:** "Zero postseason tournament entries" alone is not sufficient grounds for deletion. A school with conference standings data or dual-meet records is not an orphan. The correct disposition is `is_active = true` with an empty postseason record.

**Rollback:** `DELETE FROM conference_standings WHERE id = 895; DELETE FROM school_districts WHERE school_id = 358; DELETE FROM schools WHERE id = 358;`

**Post-run:** Upload logo via pipeline (file `358 - Roselle.svg` already in mascot library). Verify UCIAC conference standings page shows Roselle.

**Verified?** No — pending approval before execution

## 2026-06-09 — dual_meets + dual_meet_matches: missing grants patch

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260609_dual_meets_grants.sql`

**What changed:**
- The original `20260422_dual_meets_schema.sql` and `20260423_dual_meets_rls.sql` omitted explicit `GRANT` statements. Supabase did not auto-apply default privileges, so `service_role` received PG error 42501 when the batch import script attempted `SELECT`/`INSERT` on `dual_meets`.
- Added: `GRANT ALL ON TABLE dual_meets TO service_role` and same for `dual_meet_matches` so the import script can INSERT.
- Added: `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE dual_meets TO anon, authenticated` and same for `dual_meet_matches` for public-facing schedule pages.

**Rollback:** `REVOKE ALL ON TABLE public.dual_meets FROM service_role, anon, authenticated; REVOKE ALL ON TABLE public.dual_meet_matches FROM service_role, anon, authenticated;`

**Verified?** ✓ APPLIED — 2026-06-09; confirmed 385 meets and 5,390 match rows inserted with 0 errors

---

## 2026-06-08 — tournament_bouts tables: missing grants patch

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260608_tournament_tables_grants.sql`

**What changed:**
- The original schema migration omitted explicit `GRANT` statements. Supabase did not auto-apply default privileges, so `service_role` received PG error 42501 (permission denied) even for SELECT.
- Added: `GRANT ALL ON TABLE in_season_tournaments TO service_role` and `GRANT ALL ON TABLE tournament_bouts TO service_role` so the import script can INSERT.
- Added: `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE in_season_tournaments TO anon, authenticated` and same for `tournament_bouts` so the public-facing tournament pages can read data.
- Also patched `20260608_tournament_bouts_schema.sql` in-place so a fresh apply from that file is now complete.

**Rollback:** `REVOKE ALL ON TABLE in_season_tournaments FROM service_role, anon, authenticated; REVOKE ALL ON TABLE tournament_bouts FROM service_role, anon, authenticated;`

**Verified?** ✓ APPLIED — 2026-06-08; confirmed 5,172 bouts inserted across 25 tournaments with 0 errors

---

## 2026-06-08 — in_season_tournaments + tournament_bouts tables ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260608_tournament_bouts_schema.sql`

**What changed:**
- The existing `tournaments` table (postseason, integer PK) is **not touched**.
- Created `in_season_tournaments`: uuid PK, `name text NOT NULL`, `start_date date NOT NULL`, `end_date date`, `location text`, `season text NOT NULL` (e.g. "2025-26"), `created_at`. Unique index on `(name, season)` to prevent duplicate imports.
- Created `tournament_bouts`: one row per individual bout in an in-season tournament. Separate from the postseason `matches` table.
  - `in_season_tournament_id uuid` FK → `in_season_tournaments(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - `weight_class integer`, `round text`
  - `nj_wrestler1_id / nj_wrestler2_id` — nullable FKs → `wrestlers(id)` for NJ athletes
  - `wrestler1_name_raw / wrestler2_name_raw` — always populated (not null)
  - `wrestler1_school_id / wrestler2_school_id` — nullable FKs → `schools(id)`; OOS schools use is_nj=false rows or NULL
  - `wrestler1_school_raw / wrestler2_school_raw` — always populated (not null)
  - `winner smallint CHECK (winner IN (1, 2))` — 1 = wrestler1, 2 = wrestler2, NULL = DFF/no result
  - `result_type`, `result_detail`, `fall_time_seconds`
- Indexes: `idx_in_season_tournaments_name_season` (unique), `idx_tournament_bouts_tournament_id`, `idx_tournament_bouts_wrestler1_school`, `idx_tournament_bouts_wrestler2_school`, `idx_tournament_bouts_nj_wrestler1`, `idx_tournament_bouts_nj_wrestler2`
- RLS: enabled on both tables with `"public read"` policy; writes require service role.

**Rollback:** `DROP TABLE tournament_bouts; DROP TABLE in_season_tournaments;`

**Verified?** ✓ APPLIED — 2026-06-08; tables created successfully, grants applied via patch migration above

## 2026-04-22 — School colors update 2: new SVG schools + Gateway/Pennsville corrections ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260422_school_colors_update2.sql`

**What changed:**
- Part 1: Set `header_background` for 13 schools that had NULL (12 new SVG additions + Oakcrest which already had an SVG): Saddle Brook (#006400), Paterson Eastside (#CC4E10), Madison (#8F0018), Union (#8F0018), Notre Dame (#4169E1), Neptune (#000000), Point Pleasant Beach (#FFFFFF), Haddon Heights (#CC0022), Donovan Catholic (#003087), Camden Catholic (#00824B), Oakcrest (#034CB2), Gateway Reg/Woodbury (#034CB2), Northern Burlington (#454444). Only fires when `header_background IS NULL`.
- Part 2: Corrected wrong color columns — Gateway (291) had green/gold in DB but is royal blue/white/black; Pennsville (293) had green/gold but is navy/yellow (#263586/#FCE80B). Header_background for Pennsville was already correct from the prior migration.
- ID 289 (Cumberland) excluded throughout.

**Rollback:** Set 13 IDs back to NULL; restore Gateway/Pennsville to prior (incorrect) color values (see migration file ROLLBACK block)

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-22 — spot-checked all 14 affected rows via psycopg2 query

---

## 2026-04-23 — RLS policies for dual_meets and dual_meet_matches ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260423_dual_meets_rls.sql`

**What changed:**
- Enabled Row Level Security on `dual_meets` and `dual_meet_matches`
- Added `"public read"` SELECT policy (`USING (true)`) on both tables so the anon key used by browser clients can query them; write access remains service-role only

**Rollback:** Drop both `"public read"` policies and disable RLS on both tables (see migration file ROLLBACK block)

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-23 manually via Supabase SQL editor

---

## 2026-04-22 — Create dual_meets and dual_meet_matches tables ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260422_dual_meets_schema.sql`

**What changed:**
- Created `dual_meets` table: one row per dual meet event, with `season_id`, `team1_school_id`, `team2_school_id`, `meet_date`, `team1_score`, `team2_score`, `gender` (default 'M'), `status` (default 'final')
- Created `dual_meet_matches` table: one row per weight class bout, with `dual_meet_id` FK (CASCADE DELETE), `weight_class`, `wrestler_a_id`, `wrestler_b_id`, `school_a_id`, `school_b_id`, `winner_id`, `result_type`, `result_detail`, `fall_time_seconds`, `team1_points`, `team2_points`, `is_double_forfeit`, `is_forfeit_win`, `validated`
- Added index `idx_dual_meets_teams_date` on `(team1_school_id, team2_school_id, meet_date)` for duplicate detection
- Added index `idx_dual_meet_matches_dual_meet_id` on `dual_meet_id` for fast per-meet lookups
- These tables are separate from the tournament-bracket `matches` table (different schema, different use case)

**Rollback:** `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dual_meet_matches; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dual_meets;`

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-22 — both tables and both indexes confirmed via information_schema

## 2026-04-22 — School header_background updates and format normalisation ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260422_school_colors_update.sql`

**What changed:**
- Set `header_background` for 32 schools that previously had NULL, sourced from
  the 2026-04-22 mascot CSV ("School Master List.csv"), all values stored as
  canonical `#RRGGBB` hex. Schools include new SVG additions (Jefferson, Dwight
  Morrow, Manchester Regional, Westfield, South Hunterdon, Ridge, Middletown
  South, North Brunswick, Monroe, Edison, St. Joseph Metuchen, Hunterdon
  Central, Brick Township, Shore, Burlington City, Burlington Township, Ewing,
  Paul VI, West Deptford, Central Regional, Kingsway, Rancocas Valley, Seneca,
  Egg Harbor, Pennsville, Hammonton, Winslow, Penns Grove, Morris Knolls,
  Pioneer Academy, Union City, Morris Hills-Morris Knolls)
- Global Part 2 normalisation pass (name strings → hex, bare hex → `#` prefix)
  was a no-op — DB was already clean
- ID 289 (Cumberland, `#DB5B2A`) explicitly excluded

**Rollback:** Set the 32 IDs back to NULL (see migration file ROLLBACK block)

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-22 — spot-checked IDs 4, 41, 77, 136, 263, 289, 385

## 2026-04-22 — Add is_nj column to schools table ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260422_schools_is_nj.sql`

**What changed:**
- `ALTER TABLE schools ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_nj boolean DEFAULT true`
- All existing rows default to `true` (every school currently in the DB is a NJ school)
- Out-of-state schools imported via the dual-meet tool will be inserted with `is_nj = false`

**Rollback:** `ALTER TABLE schools DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_nj`

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-22 — column present with `boolean DEFAULT true`

## 2026-04-20 — Add school_id to lb_gp_team_points RPC ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_lb_gp_team_points_school_id.sql`

**What changed:**
- Dropped old `lb_gp_team_points(p_pool text)` 1-arg function
- Replaced with `lb_gp_team_points(p_pool text, p_season integer DEFAULT NULL)` returning `school_id integer` in addition to existing columns
- `school_id` resolved via `LEFT JOIN schools ON display_name` match against resolved school name
- Enables school SVG avatar display and school profile links in the girls leaderboard Team Points table

**Rollback:** Recreate prior version from `fix_lb_gp_rpcs.py` `LB_GP_TEAM_POINTS` definition (no school_id column, 1-arg signature)

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — sanity check confirmed school_id populating for known schools (e.g. Pennsauken=242, Howell=233)

## 2026-04-20 — Mascot name audit and fix (19 schools) ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_mascot_name_fix.sql`

**What changed:**
19 `UPDATE schools SET mascot` rows in two categories:

- **16 NULL → value**: Saddle River Day (Rebels), College Achieve Paterson (Phoenix), Pioneer Academy (Eagles), Newark Collegiate (Knights), Central Jersey College Prep (Cougars), Ranney (Panthers), Bordentown Regional/Florence (Scotties), Kittatinny (Cougars), Becton (Wildcats), Cherry Hill East/West (Cougar Lions), Cliffside Park/Ridgefield Memorial (Royal Raiders), Jefferson-Sparta (Spartan Falcons), Lodi/Saddle Brook (Ram Falcons), Mary Help of Christians Academy (Blue Jays), Morris Hills-Morris Knolls (Eagle Knights), Ramsey/Northern Highlands (Highlander Rams)
- **3 wrong → correct**: Emerson Boro (Cavaliers→Cabos), Nottingham (Northstars→Patriots), Buena Regional/Vineland (Wildcats→Fighting Chiefs)

Kept DB values for: Voorhees (Vikings), Haddonfield (Bulldawgs), Red Bank Regional (Buccaneers), and the more-specific group (Green Raiders, Maroon Raiders, etc.)

**Rollback:** Commented out at bottom of migration file.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — Emerson/Nottingham/Buena spot-checked correct.

## 2026-04-20 — Fix Cumberland header_background (#FFFFFF → #DB5B2A) ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_cumberland_header_bg.sql`

**What changed:**
Single-row fix: `UPDATE schools SET header_background = '#DB5B2A' WHERE id = 289`. The reseed migration seeded `#FFFFFF` from the CSV "Background: White" column, causing the school header to render white-on-white (invisible). `#DB5B2A` (Cumberland's orange primary) is the correct background.

**Rollback:** `UPDATE schools SET header_background = '#FFFFFF' WHERE id = 289`

## 2026-04-20 — School color reseed from updated CSV ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_school_colors_reseed.sql`

**What changed:**
Pure UPDATE (no schema change — columns already exist from `20260420_school_color_columns.sql`). Reseeds `color_primary`, `color_secondary`, `color_tertiary`, `header_background` for all 326 schools from the corrected School Master List CSV.

Key corrections vs initial seed:
- School 289 (Cumberland): `color_primary` `#034CB2` → `#DB5B2A`, `color_secondary` → `#443029`
- ~20 schools that had NULL `header_background` now populated (e.g. 360, 265, 286, 93, 168, 173, 305, 129, 322, 363, etc.)

**Rollback:** Re-run `docs/migrations/20260420_school_color_columns.sql` to restore prior values.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — Cumberland row confirmed `#DB5B2A`/`#443029`; 324 schools with non-null `color_primary`.

---

## 2026-04-20 — Add school color columns and initial seed ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_school_color_columns.sql`

**What changed:**
Added 4 nullable text columns to `schools` table: `color_primary`, `color_secondary`, `color_tertiary`, `header_background`. Seeded initial values for all 326 schools from School Master List CSV (colors normalized from named colors and bare hex to `#RRGGBB`).

**Rollback:** `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` all four columns.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — superseded by reseed migration same day.

## 2026-04-20 — School dedup final batch: 1 merge, 1 delete, 3 renames ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_school_dedup_final.sql`

**What changed:**

| Change | School | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Merge 300 → 356 | Saint Joseph's Academy → St. Joseph's (Hammonton) | 8 `tournament_entries`, 1 `school_aliases`, 1 `school_names` re-pointed to 356. `school_regions` (Region 8) dropped — confirmed import artifact; 356 stays on Region 7. `precomputed_team_scores` row deleted. |
| Delete 358 | Roselle | Zero tournament entries. 1 `conference_standings` row, 1 `school_districts` row deleted first. Real profile data lost (Rams, `#CC0022`, North II Group 2) — confirmed orphan. |
| Rename 94 | Hoboken High School → Hoboken | HS-suffix cleanup, no data moved |
| Rename 99 | Weehawken High School → Weehawken | HS-suffix cleanup, no data moved |
| Rename 124 | Hillside High School → Hillside | HS-suffix cleanup, no data moved |

**Post-migration:** Cleared 7 stale `precomputed_team_scores` rows for tournament 123 (Boy_s Districts District 31, season 1) — deleted when school 300 was merged. `district_team_score` RPC for District 31 now computes live from `tournament_entries`. St. Joseph's (Hammonton) entries in tournament 123 contributed 0 net team points (first-round exits, no bonus); confirmed correct.

**`update_team_scoring.py` note:** This script only recreates RPCs — it does not write to `precomputed_team_scores`. There is no standalone script to repopulate that table; clearing rows forces live RPC fallback.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — schools 300 and 358 deleted, all 8 entries on school_id=356, display names on 94/99/124 correct.

---

## 2026-04-20 — Add missing Matawan conference_standings alias ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_school_aliases_seed.sql`

**What changed:**

Added 1 missing row to `school_aliases`. `20260404_school_aliases.sql` was never applied to production — of its 21 aliases, 20 were already present (19 correct, 2 with post-consolidation IDs that are intentionally different from the original file). Only `Matawan` was genuinely absent.

Two ID corrections surfaced during pre-flight:
- Original file said `Matawan → 194` — school 194 no longer exists; canonical record is 382.
- `ON CONFLICT (alias)` syntax removed — `school_aliases` has no unique constraint on `alias`; used `WHERE NOT EXISTS` guard instead.

**Row count:** 681 → 682

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — `SELECT * FROM school_aliases WHERE alias = 'Matawan'` returns `(1666, 382, 'Matawan', 'conference_standings', NULL)`.

---

## 2026-04-20 — Fix lb_district_strength girls score lookup bug ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260420_lb_district_strength_fix.sql`

**What changed:**

RPC `lb_district_strength` had two bugs introduced via `update_rpcs.py` that broke girls postseason score data:

1. **Wrong tournament type for girls** — a `base_tt` CTE routed `p_gender = 'F'` to `tournament_type = 'girls_regions'` instead of `'districts'`. Girls district wrestlers returned zero rows.
2. **Missing girls_regions in adv_types** — the advancers check for girls only included `['girls_state']`, omitting `['girls_regions']`. Girls wrestlers who advanced to regions were not counted as advancers.

Fix removes the `base_tt` CASE WHEN routing and filters directly on `tournament_type = 'districts' AND t.gender = p_gender`, consistent with all other district-aware RPCs. `adv_types` for girls updated to `['girls_regions','girls_state']`.

`update_rpcs.py` updated to match — running that script will no longer overwrite the fix.

**No schema changes.** No enum changes. No data changes. RPC-only fix.

**Partial fix note:** Full `girls_districts` enum rename (making districts consistent with regions/state gender split) is still outstanding. See migration file header for full scope.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-20 — live DB was already patched; migration documents and re-anchors the correct state.

## 2026-04-15 — Consolidate Camden duplicate (362 → 237), Highland duplicate (298 → 369), Keansburg duplicate (373 → 191) ✓ APPLIED

**Migration files:**
- `docs/migrations/20260414_consolidate_school_362_to_237.sql`
- `docs/migrations/20260414_consolidate_school_298_to_369.sql`
- `docs/migrations/20260414_consolidate_school_373_to_191.sql`

**What changed:**

Three school consolidations applied in sequence:

| Deleted | Canonical | Entries moved | Precomputed moved | Other |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| 362 Camden/Camden Eastside | 237 Camden | 5 | 1 | — |
| 298 Highland Regional/Triton | 369 Highland | 38 | 5 | 3 aliases, 1 district, 1 region, 1 name re-pointed |
| 373 Keansburg/Henry Hudson | 191 Keansburg | 17 | 3 | — |

All three executed with safety DELETE steps for `school_regions` and `school_districts` (no-ops for 362 and 373; data migration for 298). Confirmed via `remaining_school = 0` after each.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-15 — all three school IDs confirmed deleted.

## 2026-04-15 — Merge duplicate St. Peter's Prep school 395 into 167 ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260415_merge_school_395_into_167.sql`

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries`, `precomputed_team_scores`, `school_aliases`, `school_names`, `school_regions`, `school_districts`, `schools`

**What changed:**

Consolidated duplicate St. Peter's Prep record (school_id 395, "St Peters Preparatory School") into canonical school_id 167 ("St. Peter's Prep"):
- 37 tournament_entries (tournaments 180, 152, 175) re-pointed to 167
- 3 precomputed_team_scores rows (boys season 2) re-pointed to 167
- school_names and school_aliases re-pointed to 167 (0 aliases rows affected)
- school_regions and school_districts rows deleted
- School 395 deleted

Note: `school_regions`, `school_districts`, and `school_names` were discovered as additional FK tables at execution time.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-15 — remaining_schools = 0 confirmed.

## 2026-04-15 — Merge duplicate JFK Paterson schools 331 + 402 into 74 ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260415_merge_schools_331_402_into_74.sql`

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries`, `precomputed_team_scores`, `conference_standings`, `school_aliases`, `school_names`, `school_regions`, `schools`

**What changed:**

Consolidated two duplicate Paterson JFK records into canonical school_id 74 (John F. Kennedy):
- School 331 ("Paterson Kennedy"): 1 tournament_entry, 1 conference_standings row, 1 school_alias, 1 school_names row re-pointed to 74; 1 school_regions row deleted; school deleted
- School 402 ("John F. Kennedy Patterson"): 2 tournament_entries, 3 precomputed_team_scores re-pointed to 74; school deleted

Note: `school_regions` and `school_names` were discovered as additional FK tables at execution time (not in original migration file). The school_regions row was deleted (school 74 has its own region mapping); the school_names row ("JFK Paterson" / "JFKP") was re-pointed to 74.

**Verified?** ✓ Applied 2026-04-15 — remaining_schools = 0 confirmed.

---

## 2026-04-14 — school_coops RLS + helper RPCs ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260414_school_coops_rls_and_rpcs.sql`

**Tables/functions affected:** `school_coops` (ALTER + POLICY + GRANT), `get_coop_membership` (CREATE FUNCTION), `get_coop_members` (CREATE FUNCTION)

**What changed:**

Enables RLS on the `school_coops` table (created without policies in `20260414_create_school_coops.sql`) and adds a public SELECT policy + GRANT so the anon/authenticated Supabase clients can read it. Creates two SECURITY DEFINER helper functions:
- `get_coop_membership(p_school_id int)` — returns all co-op programs a school belongs to as a member (coop_school_id, coop_name, season, gender, is_primary)
- `get_coop_members(p_coop_school_id int)` — returns all member schools for a co-op school (member_school_id, member_name, is_primary, season, gender)

Used by the frontend co-op school page feature (feature/school-coops branch).

**Reversible?** Yes — see ROLLBACK section (drop functions, revoke grant, drop policy, disable RLS)
**Verified?** Yes — applied 2026-04-14; smoke tests confirmed correct results for school 55 → coop 379, and coop 379 → [Lodi, Saddle Brook]

---

## 2026-04-14 — Create school_coops table ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260414_create_school_coops.sql`

**Tables affected:** `school_coops` (CREATE + INSERT ×10)

**What changed (pending — not yet run):**

Creates `school_coops` table to formally record co-op program membership. Each row links a co-op school record (`coop_school_id`) to an individual member school (`member_school_id`) with season, gender (`M`/`F`/`B`), and an `is_primary` flag marking the host school.

Seeded with 10 rows covering 5 co-ops:
- 365 Cliffside Park/Ridgefield Memorial → 364 Cliffside Park (primary), 357 Ridgefield Memorial — season 1, both
- 372 Jefferson-Sparta → 4 Jefferson (primary), 26 Sparta — season 2, girls
- 379 Lodi/Saddle Brook → 55 Lodi (primary), 59 Saddle Brook — season 2, both
- 385 Morris Hills-Morris Knolls → 76 Morris Hills (primary), 77 Morris Knolls — season 2, girls
- 392 Ramsey/Northern Highlands → 18 Ramsey (primary), 35 Northern Highlands — season 2, girls

**Reversible?** Yes — `DROP TABLE school_coops`
**Verified?** Yes — applied 2026-04-14

## 2026-04-14 — Consolidate school 373 → 191 (Keansburg) (PENDING REVIEW)

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260414_consolidate_school_373_to_191.sql`

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries` (UPDATE ×17), `precomputed_team_scores` (UPDATE ×3), `schools` (DELETE ×1)

**What changed (pending — not yet run):**

School 373 (`'Keansburg/Henry Hudson'`) has 17 tournament entries and 3 precomputed_team_scores rows; no aliases, districts, regions, or names. Re-points all rows to school 191 (`'Keansburg'`) and deletes school 373.

**Reversible?** Yes — see ROLLBACK section (scope rollback UPDATEs by season_id = 2 to avoid touching pre-existing school 191 rows)
**Verified?** No — pending Paul's review before execution

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries` (UPDATE), `precomputed_team_scores` (UPDATE), `school_aliases` (UPDATE), `school_districts` (INSERT ON CONFLICT + DELETE), `school_regions` (INSERT ON CONFLICT + DELETE), `school_names` (UPDATE), `schools` (DELETE ×2)

**What changed (pending — not yet run):**

1. **consolidate_school_362_to_237** — Re-points 5 `tournament_entries` and 1 `precomputed_team_scores` row from school 362 (Camden/Camden Eastside) to school 237 (Camden). School 362 has no aliases, districts, regions, or names. Deletes school 362.

2. **consolidate_school_298_to_369** — Re-points 38 `tournament_entries`, 5 `precomputed_team_scores`, 3 `school_aliases`, 1 `school_districts`, 1 `school_regions`, and 1 `school_names` row from school 298 (Highland Regional/Triton) to school 369 (Highland). Uses INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for districts/regions composite PKs. Deletes school 298.

**Reversible?** Yes — see ROLLBACK sections (districts/regions rollback requires looking up IDs before running; precomputed rollback for 298 requires scoping by tournament_type to avoid overwriting 369's pre-existing row)
**Verified?** No — pending Paul's review before execution

## 2026-04-14 — Consolidate school 326 into 259 (Gloucester) ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260414_consolidate_school_326_to_259.sql`

**Tables affected:** `conference_standings` (UPDATE ×1), `school_aliases` (UPDATE ×1), `school_regions` (INSERT ON CONFLICT + DELETE), `precomputed_team_scores` (DELETE ×1), `schools` (UPDATE display_name, DELETE ×1)

**What changed (pending — not yet run):**

School 326 (`'Gloucester'`) had 0 tournament entries and data in 4 dependent tables (conference_standings ×1, school_aliases ×1, school_regions ×1, precomputed_team_scores ×1). School 259 (`'Gloucester City JR/SR'`) had 72 tournament entries. Same school under two name variants. Re-points all 4 dependent rows to 259, renames 259's display_name to `'Gloucester'`, and deletes school 326. precomputed_team_scores row for 326 is deleted (not re-pointed) and will be recomputed.

**Reversible?** Partial — see ROLLBACK section; precomputed_team_scores row for 326 is not recoverable (acceptable)
**Verified?** Yes — applied 2026-04-14

## 2026-04-13 — Delete forfeit placeholder schools 367 and 399 ✓ APPLIED

**Migration file:** `docs/migrations/20260413_delete_schools_367_399.sql`

**Tables affected:** `matches` (DELETE), `tournament_entries` (DELETE ×11), `precomputed_team_scores` (DELETE), `schools` (DELETE ×2)

**What changed:**

Deleted synthetic forfeit placeholder schools and all dependent rows:
- School 367 (`'Forfeit'`): 7 `tournament_entries` — wrestlers A/B/C/D/E/F/G Forfeit in tournament 101 (Boy's Districts D9, season 1)
- School 399 (`'Team Forfeit'`): 4 `tournament_entries` — wrestler I Forfeit in tournament 193 (Girl's Districts D8, season 2)
- `matches` rows referencing any of the 11 forfeit entries (deleted first to satisfy FK constraints)
- `precomputed_team_scores` rows for school_ids 367 and 399
- School records 367 and 399

No real athletes affected. `matches` and `precomputed_team_scores` for these schools are not recoverable but acceptable — forfeit placeholders carry no meaningful bout or team data.

**Reversible?** Partial — `tournament_entries` and `schools` rows can be restored via ROLLBACK section; `matches` and `precomputed_team_scores` rows are not recoverable
**Verified?** Yes — applied 2026-04-14

## 2026-04-13 — School ID deduplication audit — 5 migrations ✓ APPLIED

**Migration files (apply in this order):**
1. `docs/migrations/20260413_backfill_school_404_entries.sql`
2. `docs/migrations/20260413_delete_school_398.sql`
3. `docs/migrations/20260413_consolidate_school_69_to_393.sql`
4. `docs/migrations/20260413_consolidate_school_380_to_379.sql`
5. `docs/migrations/20260413_consolidate_duplicate_schools.sql`

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries` (UPDATE/DELETE), `school_aliases` (UPDATE), `school_names` (UPDATE), `school_districts` (INSERT ON CONFLICT + DELETE), `school_regions` (INSERT ON CONFLICT + DELETE), `precomputed_team_scores` (DELETE), `schools` (UPDATE/DELETE)

**What changed:**

1. **backfill_school_404_entries** — Re-points 6 `tournament_entries` from catch-all school_id 404 (JFK/Woodbridge/Colonia) to correct individual school IDs resolved by wrestler name from source data: Evangelia Kotsonis → 150 (Iselin Kennedy), Isabella McGarry / Montedoc Hidalgo / Zoe Poznanski (×2) → 149 (Colonia), Genesis Cruz → 187 (Woodbridge). School 404 record is left in place pending verification that all entries are cleared.

2. **delete_school_398** — Deletes 2 `tournament_entries` for the synthetic "I Forfeit" placeholder wrestler (UUIDs `067a31e2`, `294ea214`) and then deletes school_id 398 (display_name `'-'`), a data import artifact with no real athletes.

3. **consolidate_school_69_to_393** — Merges school_id 69 (Bogota/Ridgefield Park, season 1) into school_id 393 (same co-op under a flipped name + trailing space, season 2). Re-points 18 season-1 `tournament_entries` (tournaments 100, 126, 133, 135). Fixes display_name: `'Ridgefield Park/ Bogota'` → `'Ridgefield Park/Bogota'`. Deletes school 69.

4. **consolidate_school_380_to_379** — Merges school_id 380 (Lodi/Saddle Brook High School — boys import) into school_id 379 (Lodi/Saddle Brook — girls import). Same co-op split across two IDs due to PDF name variation. Re-points 14 boys `tournament_entries` (tournaments 146, 173). School 379 display_name already correct. Deletes school 380.

5. **consolidate_duplicate_schools** — Single transaction consolidating 26 duplicate school ID pairs identified in the full deduplication audit. Each block re-points `tournament_entries`, migrates `school_aliases` and `school_names`, copies `school_districts` and `school_regions` (INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + DELETE loser), deletes `precomputed_team_scores` for loser (scores will be recomputed), and deletes the loser school record. Loser → winner pairs:
   - 90 → 321 (Becton), 368 → 102 (Governor Livingston), 396 → 118 (St. Benedict's), 137 → 397 (Summit)
   - 140 → 322 (Bound Brook), 142 → 383 (Middlesex/Dunellen), 161 → 384 (Monmouth Regional)
   - 202 → 370 (Jackson Memorial), 212 → 388 (Northern Burlington), 323 → 227 (Bordentown — delete only, no entries)
   - 337 → 162 (North Brunswick), 339 → 35 (Northern Highlands), 366 → 158 (East Brunswick)
   - 375 → 315 (Kittatinny), 376 → 5 (Lakeland), 377 → 62 (Lenape Valley), 386 → 56 (Mt. Olive)
   - 387 → 115 (Newark Academy), 389 → 299 (Overbrook), 390 → 78 (Parsippany Hills co-op)
   - 47 → 394 (St Joseph Montvale), 400 → 78 (Parsippany Hills HS), 401 → 75 (Montville)
   - 403 → 183 (Piscataway), 405 → 369 (Highland), 406 → 265 (Willingboro)

## 2026-04-10 — Suppress shell schools + load missing conference standings (PENDING REVIEW)

**Migration files:**
- `docs/migrations/20260410_load_missing_conference_scores.sql`
- `docs/migrations/20260410_suppress_shell_schools.sql`
- `docs/migrations/20260410_audit_entry_schools_no_scores.sql`

**Tables affected:** `conference_standings` (INSERT), `schools` (ALTER + UPDATE)

**What changed (pending — not yet run):**

1. **load_missing_conference_scores** — Inserts 9 rows into `conference_standings` for schools that appear in the 2025-26 standings source file but have no DB records: Becton, Bound Brook, High Point, Keyport, Lakeland, Monmouth, Northern Highlands, Paterson Kennedy, Roselle. Source of truth: `Conference Standings 2025-26.txt`.

2. **suppress_shell_schools** — Adds `is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true` column to `schools`, then sets `is_active = false` for 7 complete shells (zero tournament entries, zero precomputed scores, zero conference standings): IDs 332, 23, 336, 407, 65, 344, 348. The 6 schools with conference standings data (Becton, Bound Brook, High Point, Keyport, Lakeland, Roselle) were excluded and remain active. School profile pages should be updated to call `notFound()` when `is_active = false`.

3. **audit_entry_schools_no_scores** — Read-only diagnostic queries only. Investigates why Monmouth (384), Ridgefield Memorial (357), Northern Highlands (35), and Paterson Kennedy (331) have tournament entries but zero precomputed scores. No data modifications.

**Reversible?** Yes — see ROLLBACK sections in each file
**Verified?** No — pending Paul's review before execution

## 2026-04-10 — Data Health admin page (read-only queries, no schema changes)

**Tables affected:** `schools`, `wrestlers`, `tournament_entries`, `weight_classes`, `conference_standings`, `precomputed_team_scores`, `placements`

**What changed:** No schema changes. New admin page at `/admin/data-health` runs read-only SELECT queries via the service-role client to surface data integrity issues. New endpoints: `GET /api/health` (public), `GET /api/admin/data-health` (auth-gated). New service-role client at `src/lib/supabase/service.ts`.

**Reversible?** Yes — page and API routes can be deleted; no DB mutations made
**Verified?** No — pending deploy

## UNKNOWN — Initial schema creation (`schema.sql`)

**Tables affected:** `seasons`, `regions`, `districts`, `schools`, `school_aliases`, `school_districts`, `school_regions`, `tournaments`, `weight_classes`, `wrestlers`, `tournament_entries`, `matches`, `placements`

**What changed:**
- Created all 13 base tables from scratch (DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE first)
- Created 6 ENUM types: `tournament_type`, `gender_type`, `win_type`, `round_type`, `grade_label`, `bracket_side`
- Created indexes: `idx_wrestlers_name`, `idx_entries_wrestler`, `idx_entries_tournament`, `idx_entries_school`, `idx_matches_tournament`, `idx_matches_winner`, `idx_matches_loser`, `idx_placements_tournament`, `idx_placements_entry`
- Enabled RLS with "public read" policy on all 13 tables
- Note: `school_aliases` at this stage had columns `(id serial, school_id, alias, alias_type, notes)` — different from the later migration version
- Note: `tournament_entries.school_context_raw` may or may not have been in this version (see alter_schema entry below)

**Reversible?** No — full schema wipe and rebuild
**Verified?** Yes — schema confirmed against live DB structure

## UNKNOWN — Seed lookup data (`seed_lookups.sql`)

**Tables affected:** `seasons`, `weight_classes`, `tournaments`

**What changed:**
- Inserted season 1: `2024-25` (2024–2025)
- Inserted 14 boys weight classes (106–285 lb) and 12 girls weight classes (100–235 lb) — 26 total
- Inserted 48 tournaments: 32 boys districts, 8 boys regions, 1 boys state, 4 girls regions, 1 girls state, 2 combined tables

**Reversible?** Yes — DELETE by id range
**Verified?** Yes — confirmed row counts in live DB

---

## UNKNOWN — Add match import columns (`alter_schema.sql`)

**Tables affected:** `tournament_entries`, `wrestlers`

**What changed:**
- `tournament_entries`: `ADD COLUMN school_context_raw text` — raw school name/abbreviation from source PDF/CSV, intended for future FK resolution
- `wrestlers`: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX wrestlers_name_gender_unique ON wrestlers(first_name, last_name, gender)` — enables `ON CONFLICT` upserts during import

**Reversible?** Yes — DROP COLUMN / DROP INDEX
**Verified?** Yes — both confirmed present in live DB

---

## UNKNOWN — Users profile table created

**Tables affected:** `users`

**What changed:**
- Created `users` table: `id uuid` (FK to Supabase auth.users), `username text`, `user_type text DEFAULT 'fan'`, `truth_score integer DEFAULT 50`, `truth_tier text DEFAULT 'Novice'`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `primary_school_id integer`
- This is the public profile table synced from Supabase Auth on signup via trigger

**Reversible?** No (auth-integrated)
**Verified?** Yes — confirmed in live DB; migration file not found

---

## UNKNOWN — App users table created

**Tables affected:** `app_users`

**What changed:**
- Created `app_users` table: `id uuid`, `role user_role DEFAULT 'fan'` (custom enum), `display_name text`, `school_id integer`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Purpose appears to be a secondary auth layer or admin role table, distinct from `users`

**Reversible?** Yes — DROP TABLE
**Verified?** Yes — confirmed in live DB; migration file not found

---

## UNKNOWN — Bracket picks feature

**Tables affected:** `bracket_picks`

**What changed:**

## 2026-04-04 — School aliases v2 migration (not applied to live DB)

**Tables affected:** `school_aliases`

**What changed (intended):**
- Would have replaced `school_aliases` with a new schema: `id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS`, `alias text UNIQUE`, `school_id int NOT NULL`, `source text`, `created_at`
- Would have seeded 21 aliases from conference standings audit
- **Status: this migration was NOT applied to the live DB.** The live DB retains the original `school_aliases` schema from `schema.sql` (columns: `alias_type`, `notes`). The 21 alias seeds were inserted via another method.

**Reversible?** N/A — not applied
**Verified?** No — migration file exists at `supabase/migrations/20260404_school_aliases.sql` but live DB schema does not match

---

## 2026-04-05 — Districts and regions logo_url + permissions

**Tables affected:** `districts`, `regions`

**What changed:**
- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements were no-ops (tables already existed)
- Seeded district rows 1–32 and region rows 1–8 via `generate_series` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Granted `SELECT` to `anon`, `authenticated`; `ALL` to `service_role`
- Note: `logo_url` column on `districts` and `regions` exists in live DB but the ALTER TABLE adding it is not tracked here — predates or is missing from migration files

**Reversible?** Partially — REVOKE grants; seed rows can be deleted if no FKs exist
**Verified?** Partially — migration file: `supabase/migrations/20260405_districts_regions_tables.sql`; `logo_url` column origin untracked

---

## Guidelines for Future Entries

- Add an entry **before merging** any PR that touches the database
- Include the migration filename in **What changed** if one exists
- If the change is a data backfill only (no DDL), still document it
- If you run a one-off SQL command in the Supabase dashboard, add it here retroactively
- Mark **Verified?** as `yes` only after confirming the change is live in production
